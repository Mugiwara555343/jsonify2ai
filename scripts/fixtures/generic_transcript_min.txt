User: How do I create a Python virtual environment?

Assistant: You can create a Python virtual environment using the `venv` module. Here's how:

1. Open your terminal
2. Navigate to your project directory
3. Run: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate it:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

Once activated, you'll see `(venv)` in your prompt, and any packages you install will be isolated to this environment.

User: Thanks! How do I deactivate it?

Assistant: Simply run `deactivate` in your terminal. This will exit the virtual environment and return you to your system Python.
